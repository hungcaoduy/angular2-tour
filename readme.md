angular.io tutorial

@Rodd Please find my answer below:
1) My question is do we have to use the "place rank" sort option?
No, we don't, theoretically. However, we faced some issues when sorting by distance.
I suggest we keep this "place rank" sorting option for now, and if you want, we will test more about other option 
2) Can we pick and choose which sub-categories we want to keep? 
Let me know if this is possible and how involved this is for you to implement.
Also, do you think this would help with speed and relevancy?

3)  why the store "white house black market" cannot be found on staging but can be found on production

4) In the future, do you think it's possible to create a tool to convert store names that are not accurate into "readable" names for Factual?
